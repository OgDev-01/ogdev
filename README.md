-   [Atomic Design by Brad Frost](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)
-   [Atomic Design - How To Make Web and UI Design Easier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3A33dmp17E)

## üìô Storybook

-   [Introduction to Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction)

## Getting Started

### üñ•Ô∏è Local development

To install the application:

```shell
npm install
```

To start a local copy of the app on port `3000`:

```shell
npm run dev
```

### üöÄ Production deployment

A production deployment is a complete build of the project, including the build of the static assets.

```shell
npm run build
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
